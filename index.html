             We are testing a new approach for Defi 2.0 projects to launch with fully transparent on-chain market making &amp; no shenanigans. On-chain launches are quite a different beast with a ton of coordination needed between infrastructure partners, and education of new concepts for users (slippage, gas, network congestions, price curves).
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Jupiter is pushing it to the limit with more than 1 million users &amp; bots claiming &amp; trading at the same time — join us in the pioneering mess &amp; pave the way for future projects to launch on-chain!

             We are using a custom single-sided Meteora DLMM pool as a novel mechanism to bootstrap early liquidity. It has a low inital price for rapid price discovery and to attract immediate USDC liquidity for paper paws to dump. It also provides early backstop liquidity that the team cannot withdraw. 100% transparent and on chain, no drama.
